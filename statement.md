# Problem statement:
Students and young professionals find it hard to track daily expenses and see simple summaries of where money goes. This project implements a minimal expense tracker that stores expenses, allows CRUD operations, and generates simple summaries.

## Scope:
- Local single-user application
- SQLite storage
- CLI menu-based interface

## Target users: students who want a small expense tracker with no web UI.

## High-level features:
- Add expense (date, amount, category, note)
- Edit/delete expense
- View list and filters
- Monthly total and per-category totals
